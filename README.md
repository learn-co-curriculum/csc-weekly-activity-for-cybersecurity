# Career Services Commitment - Cybersecurity Weekly Job Search Activity

The [Career Services Commitment](https://flatironschool.com/career-services-commitment/) outlines a set of weekly job search activity that graduates must fulfill in order to remain eligible for Flatiron’s Money-Back Guarantee (please see the [Terms of Service](https://learn.co/tos) you acknowledged upon enrollment for full eligibility requirements). What does weekly job search activity mean, and what does it consist of? We have outlined specific activities that will help you to stay on track, source opportunities, and spend your time effectively to help you move closer to your goal of getting a job.

Since we opened our doors in 2012, we have had the opportunity to guide over 1,500 graduates through job searches — and see what students did to land themselves jobs. We have thought carefully about how to guide our students to be proactive and successful in their job search, by outlining specific activities that successful students did to facilitate their job offers. This information helped us to craft the Career Services Commitment, which includes requirements for specific activities we ask students to engage in every week they are job-seeking. Those include: 

- *Make contact with at least eight (8) individuals, verified by first, last name and title, at prospective employers within your field of study with respect to the Money-Back Guarantee Qualifying Program (recording evidence of such contact to be furnished upon request by Flatiron School) and update your job-search tracking tool with a written summary of all such job search activities*
- *Post at least one (1) written or video blog post (containing your original thoughts and ideas, providing all appropriate citations and references to third-party content from other sources), focused on a topic in your field of study with respect to the Money-Back Guarantee Qualifying Program, on a public URL that can be verified by Flatiron School*
- *For students enrolled in a course in the cybersecurity analytics field of study, you must complete 2 levels of the Over The Wire - Bandit challenge per week. Once complete with all levels of Bandit, you must complete 1 level per week of Over The Wire - Leviathan. At the completion of each level, provide a screen grab of the successful completion notification from the Over The Wire website to Flatiron School for review.*
- *For students enrolled in a course in the cybersecurity engineering field of study, you must complete 1 level of the Over The Wire - Leviathan challenge per week. Once complete with all levels of Leviathan, you must complete 1 level of the following Over The Wire challenges per week in this order: Narnia, Behemoth & Utumno. At the completion of each level, provide a screen grab of the successful completion notification from the Over The Wire website to Flatiron School for review.*

Let’s dive deeper into each of these activities...

## Make Contact with 8 Specific People
**(Cybersecurity Analytics and Cybersecurity Engineering students)**

View our [Career Services Commitment Contact Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T6VCXuPuZBdB0mCnYtBc6-3YiVLIYxxtce1f2KUHZ8I/edit?usp=sharing) to understand what does and doesn't count as 'contacts'.

We know it feels great to hit “Submit” on a job application. The “Submit” button turns into a green check-mark, which literally sends a dopamine rush to your brain. It’s so tempting to bask in that green check-mark and think you’ve done your part, that now the ball is in the employer’s court. But we’ve seen time and time again that this is an ineffective strategy. Why?

People don’t get jobs from job boards, they get jobs from people! When submitting an application electronically, the chances are small that your application is being carefully reviewed by a human. As a matter of fact, most companies utilize applicant tracking systems (aka. ‘ATS’) to quickly scan your application to identify keywords to determine if a candidate should move forward. If all you do is hit “Submit,” you’re going to be on the bottom of a digital pile of hundreds of resumes, and a human may never actually lay eyes on your materials. In addition, it’s estimated that [70-80% of jobs are never even posted.](https://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133474431/a-successful-job-search-its-all-about-networking)

Instead of relying on the [“black hole” of job board submissions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E3ABerhq3k), we want you to focus on connecting with an actual human who is relevant to your search. Connecting with people allows you to build out your professional network and develop relationships with people who may be able to help you. It gives you a chance to tell your story, and to communicate your passion for your craft.

Connecting with people can happen via two means: in-person or electronically.
* **In-person - informal networking:** You could go to a meetup or an event and strike up a conversation with the person sitting next to you, or approach the presenter at the end of the event. Meeting new people face to face is a great way to build connections. However, simply having a nice conversation and parting ways does not guarantee that this person becomes part of your ongoing network. You should nurture this contact by sending them a follow-up email the next day (or the same night!) to keep communication going.
* **In-person - formal interview processes:** Another way of connecting with people is throughout the stages of an interview process. Every time you have a meaningful conversation (including formal interviews), it helps you to advance in your job search!
* **Electronically - warm outreach:** Maybe you email an old colleague, call up a former roommate, or your brother connects you to his girlfriend’s mother (all of whom work in jobs you want to work in, or at companies you want to work for). You schedule a phone call, a coffee, or grab drinks to learn more about their role and their company, and ideally to learn about openings and/or contacts in their network that can be helpful. In this situation, you are connecting individually with a person who can provide advice, guidance, and/or support in your search - these activities count!
* **Electronically - cold outreach:** It is completely normal, and appropriate, to send cold outreach emails to contacts at companies you are interested in. Maybe the company isn’t hosting an event anytime soon, or you have no personal connections there. That’s okay! You don’t want to lose the opportunity to get your foot in the door, so you can use email in hopes of opening the line of communication. As long as your email is professional, polite, and clear as to why you are reaching out, it won’t be negatively received. Sure, some people won’t answer - and that’s okay! It is imperative to generate quality, customized outreach to pique employers’ interest and elicit responses.

You can fulfill your goal of 8 individual contacts per week with outreach emails, or a combination of event follow-up emails, cold outreach, informal coffees with personal connections, and/or interviews! The idea is to connect with real live people throughout your search. If you have specific questions (which you will), make sure to connect with your Career Coach, so they can help you to navigate every step of this process!

**Examples of quality individual contacts:**

* *Different stages of an interview*
  * *Phone screen, video call, on-site/meet the team, etc.*
* *Cold emailing a fellow practitioner who works at a company you’re interested in*
* *Having coffee, lunch, or a networking call with a friend, former colleague, family member, friend of a friend, your girlfriend’s mother’s sister’s landlord who works in your field of study and may be able to connect you to some influential people, etc.*
* *Meeting new people at a meetup or event, and sending an email the next day to keep the line of communication open*
* *Sending an email to a fellow practitioner, asking for advice/feedback on a project, resume, or blog post (advice helps you to become a better practitioner and job seeker!)*

NOTE: Talking to **external** recruiters does not count towards the 8 connections per week (as they are not individuals at prospective employers within your field of study). If you want to talk to an external recruiter, that is okay! But it will need to be in addition to your 8 individual contacts. (Check out [this article](https://www.quora.com/What-do-tech-recruiters-think-about-programming-bootcamps-like-Hack-Reactor-DigitalCrafts-MakerSquare-and-Dev-Bootcamp/answer/Rebekah-Rombom-1) that explains why we encourage students to focus their efforts directly on the companies they want to work for.)
Keep in mind that some leads that you pursue will respond quickly, while others might take a week or two to get back to you. Some you won’t ever hear from, and that’s okay. This is why we suggest the amount of activity that we do, because we know what amount of activity it takes to run a successful job search.


## Technical Blog Post
**(Cybersecurity Analytics and Cybersecurity Engineering students)**

This topic is covered at length in the Career Prep Track Your Online Presence/Blogging Tips lesson, but we’re touching on it again because a weekly blog is a required activity within the Career Services Commitment.

Blogs demonstrate to employers that you’re passionate about your craft and can communicate the projects you’re building and the concepts you’re learning to a general audience – an important skill for job seekers. When an employer peruses the LinkedIn profiles of 2 candidates with equal credentials – but one is an active blogger on technical topics, and the other isn’t – it’s obvious which candidate the employer is going to be more excited to speak with. You want to be that candidate!

You can blog about almost anything related to your learning. You will be learning new skills, technologies and frameworks along your journey. You will be implementing those new skills to projects, getting stuck, and implementing solutions. Write about it all! Topics of interest, for you and for others, can truly run the gamut from solving a technical or design challenge to lessons learned while interviewing. When you begin to identify companies of interest – and even interview with them – look out for topics that could be relevant to the company, and write about them! 

The key here is also to post your blog to a public URL: Medium, Facebook, LinkedIn, your personal website – anywhere that can generate activity and get your blog seen by others. If you have any specific questions, just connect with your Career Coach.
